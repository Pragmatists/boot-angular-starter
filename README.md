IDE setup
---------

IntelliJ IDEA 2016.1.1:

1. Do not import this project in IntelliJ IDEA. Instead open in order to keep configuration files
   which are tracked in a Git repository (inspections, code style etc.)
   
2. When opening pop-up will appear with information that there are not imported Gradle modules
   present in a project. Click on "Import Gradle project" link in order to import them.
   
3. Do not worry about pop-up with information that there is VCS root to be mapped. VCS (Git)
   will enable automatically during Gradle modules import.
